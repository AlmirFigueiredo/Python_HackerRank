Introduction

HackerRank is a popular platform that offers coding challenges and competitions to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various HackerRank problems, focusing on problem solving using Python.

Each problem is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook file, providing a detailed explanation of the problem statement, approach, and step-by-step solution. Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for interactive coding and documentation, allowing you to run code cells individually and provide detailed explanations along the way.

Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Install Python: Visit the official Python website at python.org and download the latest version of Python for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup.

2. Install Jupyter Notebook: Once Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook using pip (Python's package manager):

   pip install jupyter

3. Clone the repository: Use the git clone command to clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/AlmirFigueiredo/hackerrank-python.git

4. Change directory: Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:

   cd hackerrank-python

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook: Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

   jupyter notebook

Your web browser should open automatically, displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Usage

Once you have launched Jupyter Notebook and accessed the interface, you can navigate to the desired problem's notebook file (.ipynb) and open it. Each notebook includes the problem statement, code cells with the solution, and explanations.

You can run individual code cells by selecting them and clicking the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter. This allows you to execute the code and observe the output or modify the code and experiment with different inputs.

Feel free to explore the provided notebooks, understand the solutions, and adapt them as needed.
